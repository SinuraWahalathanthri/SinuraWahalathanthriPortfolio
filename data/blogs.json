      "content": "### DK Products E-Cormmerce Website \n\n This project was developed as part of my univercity viva, but I treated it as a real-world product rather than just an acedemic submission just for my sir's to see. I chose **DK Products** Since its one of my friends parents bussiness, its a Sri Lankan Spice Brand it has been brand for over a 3 years period. I wanted to work on something local and maninly practical since it was a main requirment in our viva. So basically the main objective of the viva presentation was to build a working e-cormmerce website that could be realisticly used in a actual small bussiness. I have designed the entire website from scratch using figma and all the code are pure html, css, and js and as the frameworks i have used UI Kit and Bootstrap for Styling and Animations, and the backend was handled by PHP since the viva projects main subject was PHP, so for the database i have used MySQL since its one of the most efficient databases to run locally. I have focused on the UI/UX heavily since i want to keep the user expirience simple and smooth, especially for the first time users. I have carefully designed the tables structures, and the relationships of the products, user, address, and catergories very carefully in MySQL (Have gone until 4th Normalization). Handling form validation and image uploads securely was another important learning point, as these are critical areas in real-world applications.This project helped me gain a much deeper understanding of **full-stack development** and how different components of a system work together. More importantly, it gave me confidence in building functional systems that go beyond theory and actually solve a real problem.**Technologies Used:** PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript "

      "content": "### HeyBuddy Chat Application \n\nHeyBuddy was built as my **React Native viva project**, and the idea was to create a real-time chat application that feels familiar and modern, similar to apps people use every day. I wanted to challenge myself by working on real-time communication instead of a simple CRUD-based application. \n\nThe app supports instant messaging, user presence, typing indicators, read receipts, and media sharing. I developed the mobile application using React Native and designed the UI to be clean, responsive, and easy to use on different screen sizes. For the backend, I used PHP with MySQL and built structured APIs to handle messages, users, and chat sessions. \n\nOne of the most challenging parts of this project was handling real-time message updates efficiently. I had to optimize database queries and manage message synchronization so chats felt instant and reliable. Designing the backend APIs in a way that could scale was another important learning experience. \n\nThis project taught me how messaging systems work behind the scenes and gave me hands-on experience with **real-time systems, backend optimization, and API design**. It also improved my confidence in building complete mobile applications rather than focusing only on frontend features. \n\n**Technologies Used:** React Native, PHP, MySQL, WebSockets"

      "content": "### Lifeline Mental Health App \n\nLifeline is a mental health application developed while working with **Tecxa’s Research & Development Team**. The goal of this project was to create a platform that could support mental wellbeing in schools and workplaces through technology. Unlike most academic projects, this was a professional, research-driven application with real impact. \n\nThe app includes features such as mood tracking, wellness reminders, guided counseling modules, and early warning indicators that help identify mental health risks. I contributed to UI/UX design, mobile app development, API integration, and overall system planning. A lot of emphasis was placed on accessibility and user comfort, as mental health applications require a very thoughtful design approach. \n\nWorking on Lifeline taught me how large-scale applications are built in a team environment. I learned how to collaborate with designers, researchers, and developers while following proper development workflows. It also gave me insight into building software for sensitive domains like healthcare. \n\nOur work on Lifeline received a **Merit Award at the BCS – NBQSA National ICT Awards 2024** under the *eHealth & Wellbeing* category, which was a huge milestone for the team and for me personally. \n\n**Technologies Used:** React Native, React, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, MySQL"

      "content": "### NASA Space Apps Challenge Weather App \n\nThis project was built for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**, where our team worked on an advanced weather forecasting application. The goal was to provide long-term and short-term weather predictions using reliable datasets and AI-based forecasting models. \n\nWe used **Prophet AI** for prediction and integrated NASA-supported weather calibration datasets to improve accuracy. The frontend was built using React, while Firebase handled authentication and real-time data updates. A major focus was on data visualization, ensuring that complex weather information was easy to understand for users. \n\nThe challenge was intense and time-limited, which pushed us to make quick yet effective technical decisions. Working under pressure helped me improve my problem-solving skills and teamwork. I was deeply involved in frontend development, data handling, and system integration. \n\nOur efforts paid off when we won **1st Place in Sri Lanka** and were nominated for the global stage. We later became the **first Sri Lankan team to reach the Top 40 Global Finalists** out of more than 1,290 teams worldwide. This project remains one of the most memorable experiences in my journey. \n\n**Technologies Used:** React, Firebase, Prophet AI, NASA APIs"

The objective was to build a complete Point-of-Sale system that could realistically be used by retail businesses. \n\nThe system includes billing and sales processing, inventory management, supplier tracking, stock alerts, and reporting features. I designed all UI components using **Java Swing**, focusing on clarity and ease of use. The backend logic and database operations were handled using MySQL, following object-oriented principles. \n\nOne of the key challenges was ensuring data consistency across sales, inventory, and reports. This project strengthened my understanding of **OOP concepts**, database integration, and desktop application development. \n\n**Technologies Used:** Java Swing, MySQL, OOP"

The main goal was to create a friendly and welcoming online presence for parents who are exploring early-childhood education options. \n\nThe website showcases the school’s services, facilities, staff, and enrollment details. I focused heavily on clean layouts, readability, and responsive design so the site works well on both desktop and mobile devices. \n\nThis project helped me improve my frontend fundamentals and attention to detail in UI design. \n\n**Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP"

The app controls pod door automation, delivery tracking, drone coordination, and real-time IoT sensor monitoring. \n\nI handled the complete UI/UX design and mobile app development while also managing the team. This project significantly improved my leadership skills and understanding of IoT-integrated systems. \n\n**Technologies Used:** React Native, Node.js, IoT Systems, Team Leadership"
