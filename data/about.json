    "I started coding when I was 10, and in 2021 I began my BSc (Hons) in Software Engineering at the Java Institute for Advanced Technology. From the start, my goal has been to build a career as a software engineer, and I’ve been working towards that ever since.",
    "I studied at St. Peter’s College, Bambalapitiya, and I’m from Sri Lanka. I really enjoy building software that actually solves problems and experimenting with new technologies along the way.",
    "These days, I mostly focus on full-stack development and building fast, accessible applications. When I’m not coding, I like keeping up with new tech trends, playing guitar, gaming (valorant, minecraft, and some other fun stuff), and working on personal projects."
